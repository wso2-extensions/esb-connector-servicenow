##  Integration tests for WSO2 EI Salesforce SOAP connector

### Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.8
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-connector-integrationbase

### Tested Platform:
 - UBUNTU 16.04
 - WSO2 EI 6.5.0

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download WSO2 EI 6.5.0 from official website and place it to {EI_Connector_Home}/repositiry/.

 2. Create a Salesforce account.

 3. Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to Salesforce instance url(Eg:- https://ap4.salesforce.com) and place it to {EI_Connector_Home}/repositiry/.
        
 4. To access Salesforce, replace your current password with a combination of your password and a security token.

   Steps

       1. Log into Salesforce via the browser to request your security token.

       2. Do one of the following:
 
           If you have a regular Salesforce account, go to Setup > My Personal Information > Reset Security Token.

           If you have a Salesforce developer account, from the home page, go to Manage Users > Users > click your name > Change password > Reset Security Token.

       3. This triggers an email which contains your security token.

       4. Select and copy the token from the email.

       Replace your Salesforce password with combination of the password and the security token. For example, if your password is "MyPassword" and your security token is "XXXXXX", you would enter "MyPasswordXXXXXX" in the Password field.
