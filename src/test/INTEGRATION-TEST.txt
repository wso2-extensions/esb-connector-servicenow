Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB ServiceNow connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - UBUNTU 15.10
 - WSO2 ESB 4.9.0

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download ESB 4.9.0 from official website.

 3. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.9.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location "{SERVICENOW_CONNECTOR_HOME}/repository/".

 4. Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access serviceNow API over https.

   	i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to https://{instance_name}.service-now.com
   	ii)  Go to new ESB 4.9.0 folder and place the downloaded certificate in both "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and "{SERVICENOW_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" folders.
   	iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import servicenow certificate in to keystore.
   		 Give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

   		 NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from servicenow. (e.g. *.servicenow.com)
   			    CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. servicenow)

   	iv)  Navigate to "{SERVICENOW_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import Shopify certificate in to keystore.
   		Give "wso2carbon" as password.

   		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from servicenow, change it accordingly. (e.g. *.servicenow.com)
   			   CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. servicenow)

 5. Create a ServiceNow instance using serviceNow developer site and derive the username and password.
	i)   Using the URL "https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/home" register a ServiceNow account.
	ii)  Login to the created Service-Now account and go to Manage >> Instance.
	iii) Then you will get a username and password for your instance with instance URL. you can change your password by going Action >> Reset admin password.
	iv)  In your instance you will get three types of APIs and some pre defined tables.
